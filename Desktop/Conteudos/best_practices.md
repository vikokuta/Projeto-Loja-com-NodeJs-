###Coding best practices

-Here are some best practices you should have in mind:

##1. Use consistent indentationThere is no right or wrong indentation that everyone should follow. The best style, is a consistent style. Once you start competing in large projects you’ll immediately understand the importance of consistent code styling.
##2. Don’t Repeat YourselfThe same piece of code should not be repeated over and over again.
##3. Avoid Deep NestingToo many levels of nesting can make code harder to read and follow.

##4. Limit line length Long lines are hard to read. It is a good practice to avoid writing horizontally long lines of code.
##5. File and folder structureYou should avoid writing all of your code in one of 1-2 files. That won’t break your app but it would be a nightmare to read, debug and maintain your application later.Keeping a clean folder structure will make the code a lot more readable and maintainable.
##6. Naming conventionsUse of proper naming conventions is a well known best practice. Is a very common issue where developers use variables like X1, Y1 and forget to replace them with meaningful ones, causing confusion and making the code less readable.
##7. Keep the code simpleThe code should always be simple. Complicated logic for achieving simple tasks is something you want to avoid as the logic one programmer implemented a requirement may not make perfect sense to another. So, always keep the code as simple as possible.

##8. Use your IDE’s drop-down menu
Not so much a standard, but a good practice, these are very helpful and will help you make less coding errors.
For example:If you want to rename a variable or a method, just use the “refactor” option of your IDE and it will change all the calls to that method/variable name. You don’t have to change them one by one which will make your code prone to error/failure.If you want to create getter/setter methods of all your private variables, just use “create getter/setter” and the IDE will automatically create the methods for you.
##9. Backup and save your work often
Dead battery, blackout, software glitch, fire, nuclear disaster – all of these may result in loss of data. Making sure you save often and back up your code on some kind of version control system is a simple way to ensure that your code stays safe.
