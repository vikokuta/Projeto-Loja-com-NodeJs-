###Coding Standards
-A coding standard ensures that all developers writing the code in a particular language write according to the **guidelines** specified. This makes the code easy to understand and provides consistency in the code. One of the most essential factors in a software system is the consistency of the coding standard.

-Coding standards are **collections of rules** and guidelines that determine the programming style, procedures, and methods for a programming language.

##Common Aspects of Coding Standard :
*Naming Conventions: The naming convention is how your packages, classes methods, variables, etc. should be named. ( eg. camelCase, PascalCase or snake_case)
*File and folder Naming and Organization: This is how your file and folder should be named and structured
*Formatting and Indentation: the code should be written in a standardized format and indentation
*Commenting and Documenting: This makes it easy for the reviewer of your code to better understand codes methods and declarations
*Classes and Functions: This specifies how classes and functions should behave.
*Testing: This specifies which approach and tools should be used to test the codes
